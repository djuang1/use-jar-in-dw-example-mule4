# Call a Java Method from a JAR file in DataWeave
 
Reuse is a major tenant of the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform. Instead of being a black box where developers donâ€™t know what the code is doing under the covers, they can reuse code or leverage their own code within a Mule application. 

Sometimes this code can be sitting in a *.jar file and the developer just wants to call some methods from the Mule app. In this repo, it contains an example project that shows you how to add the *.jar file to a Mule project and reference it from DataWeave directly.
